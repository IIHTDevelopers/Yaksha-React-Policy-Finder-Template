* You can follow series of command to setup React environment once you are in your project-name folder:

	npm install -> Will install all dependencies -> takes 10 to 15 min

	npm run start -> To compile and deploy the project in browser. You can press <Ctrl> key while clicking on localhost:8080/8081 to open project in browser -> takes 2 to 3 min

	npm run json-start -> As we are using a json server to mimic our db.json file as a database. So, this command is useful to start a json server.

        npm run test -> to run all test cases. It is mandatory to run this command before submission of workspace -> takes 5 to 6 min  
  
* You may also run “npm run jest” while developing the solution to re-factor the code to pass the test-cases.
